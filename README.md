# Numerust
It's a simple project of numerical methods for solving equations, systems of equations, integrals, differential equations etc.

For now there is implemented:
- Matrix visaulisation in txt file (mostly for the debugging purpose).
- Newton optimisation for an f(x) function.
- Gauss-Seidel method for solving matrices with a strong diagonal.
- Matrix inversion by LU decomposition.
- Least squares approximation for f(x).
